Experimenting by solving interview questions applying TDD

## Description

Please don't take this repository to seriously because I am not taking it seriously either.
The purpose of this repository is for me to test and experiment concepts related with 
interview questions and Test Driven Develoment.

Many thing here could be wrong, if so, you are free to point it out as issues if and 
only if you provide an answer. I welcome constructive critism, not complains.

The reason I am doing this is that I do not solve this kind of problems at work.
The mind is a muscle like any other muscle in the body and if you don't train it
propertly for a task, it will perform it poorly.

Years ago, an interview was something simple. A few phone calls, a few face to face talks,
spend at most 30 minutes on the white board solving business related issues (not puzzles) 
and you got the job.

Now, things have changes. My worse experience was to be interviewed by 12 people while spending 8 hours being interviewed. It was insane. In my whole life as a developer and interviewer, I never encounted something like that.
However, I went along because I wanted to live the experience at least once.

Interviewing itself have become an industry. There are books, videos, and sites.
It has become the equivalent to the SAT. If there is something I learned about the SAT is that the 
only purpose to study the SAT is to pass the SAT.

Anyways, you were warned. I will commit many mistakes here and if you go ahead and just 
copy me or based your learning on this without analyzing it first to ensure its right, 
you will be commiting a terrible mistake.

Also, I will not be going over my grammar. Normally, I would spend hours reviewing, over and over again,
to ensure that everything I write is correctly but this is not going to be the case.

Again, this is a playground where I am planning to play and have fun. Enjoy.
