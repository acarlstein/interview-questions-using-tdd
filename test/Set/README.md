# Set

I created a primite Set. The reason I called primitive is that it uses an Array as a container instead of a HashMap which would be more efficience.

TypeScript/JavaScript doesn't have the same kind of HashMap that Java has; therefore, I will have to create one

## TODO

Replace the Array with an HashMap
