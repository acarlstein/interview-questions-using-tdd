# Over Simplified Standard Library

## Set

I created a primite Set. The reason I called primitive is that it uses an Array as a container instead of a HashMap which would be more efficience.

TypeScript/JavaScript doesn't have the same kind of HashMap that Java has; therefore, I will have to create one

### TODO

Replace the Array with an HashMap

## Stack

Using TDD, create a basic Stack in which we can  push a value, pop a value, peek the top of the stack, check if the stack is empty and check how many elements are in the stack.

## Linked List

Linked List is one of the tools used by other Data Structures such as Hashtable and HashMaps
